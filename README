Welcome to Neta and Erin's super fun Boggle game

We've added some fun features just for you! ;)
* backspace - enables you to cancel the sequence of letters pressed, without losing the rest of the entered word

* highscore - allows you to see your highscore of the rounds you've played in the curretn game! this way you can see how you stack up to your previous games and if you need to reread the disctionary before next round ;)

* intuitive gameplay - you will only be able to press valid buttons, which will show up in green, while invlaid will become inactive and red. this will save you time thinking and let you score more points!

Have fun and we hope you enjoy!!
